# public-engagement

This repository contains resources for a public engagement idea, developed as part of my precision medicine DTP.

Access the Apps: 
- App based on inputting data as results are published: https://francescatinsdeall.shinyapps.io/projectengagementapp/
- App based on yearly review of available data: https://francescatinsdeall.shinyapps.io/appbasedonselectingyear/

Explore the Data: Download `data_for_app.csv` to interact with the data. You can:
- Upload the full dataset as a CSV file (and remove later studies to observe how cumulative meta-analysis results evolve).
- Manually enter study data one by one using the Manual Entry tab.

Feel free to explore and experiment :)
